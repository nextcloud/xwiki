### Added

 - Users can disable wikis they donâ€™t want to use from their personal settings
 - When registering a wiki, its URL is autofixed when possible (a  missing
   '/xwiki' is added for instance)
 - A CHANGELOG.md file

### Changed

 - The welcome screen is hopefully nicer to read
 - Registering a wiki is now more user-friendly, with guiding onboarding
   messages
 - When registering a wiki, `instance_uri` is passed to XWiki, so XWiki can
